        <H2>Why categorization</H2>
        <P>The stated goal directs us to how the popular vote in each province compares to the representation in Federal Parliament, for the top four federal political parties.
        It may be worthwhile to suggest a more detailed interpretation of this goal, but based on this general objective only, here is the action/target pairs identified per the Why methodology:</P>
        <br>
        <p>Analysis level: action/target is "discover features". With the vague goal about how the popular vote in each province compares to the representation in Federal Parliament, for the top four federal political parties.
            , this is a very broad analysis objective.<br>
            Search level: action/target is "browse similarity". Since we are directed to The Result and candidates data , but nothing about how Successful the candidates are able to vote the number of accepted votes.<br>
            Query level: action/target is "compare distribution". Since we are directed to Result and Candidates data, I think it would be helpful to compare distribution of these attributes with respect to the winner of the Election. I could also see "summarize" being useful, but too far from the objective of finding "patterns".</p>
