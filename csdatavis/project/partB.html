    <h2>Attributions</h2>
    <p>I attest that this webpage, which contains WHAT and WHY analysis comparing the COVID-19 data for USA with 4 other countries, 
        was solely my work, using some of the class texts and Tamara Munzner's book of Visualization Design.</p>

    <h2>Materials</h2>
    <p>The dataset used in making these d3 visualizations was downloaded in CSV format <a href="https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data">here,</a> and preprocessed using jupyter notebook. A subset of the 
        data containing 5 selected countries, including USA, with the mean of the stringency index, total cases and deaths per million, in each month 
        since March, up till October for each of the countries, which are: United States, United Kingdom, New Zealand, Canada and Australia.</p>

    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Broad goal: </b> <i>To compare USA COVID-19 response with Canada, New Zealand, UK and Austrailia.</i></li>
        <li><b>Sub goal: </b><i>To compare the stringency index of the five countries.</i></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>What Analysis</h2>
    <h4>
        Covid19-data.csv:
    </h4>
        This dataset <b>shows</b> each countries with their mean stringency index, mean total cases and deaths per million in a month.
    <ul>
        <li>location identifies the geographical location (country).<ul><li><b>What:</b>Geometry, categorical</li></ul></li>
        <li>month is the month in which the data was taken.<ul><li><b>What:</b>Ordered, ordinal and cyclic</li></ul></li>
        <li>mean_stringency_index is the composite measure of government's response based on a 9-response indicator including school closures, 
            workplace closures, and travel bans, rescaled to a value from 0 to 100 (100 = strictest response)<ul><li><b>What:</b>Ordered, quantitative.</li></ul></li>
        <li>mean_total_cases_per_million shows the average total confirmed cases of COVID-19 per 1,000,000 people.<ul><li><b>What:</b>Ordered, quantitative</li></ul></li>
        <li>mean_total_deaths_per_million shows the average total deaths attributed to COVID-19 per 1,000,000 people<ul><li><b>What:</b>Ordered, quantitative</li></ul></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Analysis</h2>
    <p>The sub goal is to compare the government's response (stringency index) to COVID19 of the countries based on a 9-response indicator including school closures, 
        workplace closures, and travel bans, rescaled to a value from 0 to 100 (100 = strictest response). The WHY analysis would be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Analysis level: </b> action/target is "discover similarities". I think we can identify which countries share same high months and low months.</li>
            <li><b>Search level: </b> action/target is "explore distribution". Based off our working data, we can explore how consistent countries can be retaining a high response rate to COVID19.</li>
            <li><b>Quuey level: </b> action/target is "compare trends". Since we are working with response rate for countries, it would be helpful to compare 
                the various government responses across each of the months.</li>
        </ul>
