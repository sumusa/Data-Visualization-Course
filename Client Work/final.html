    <h2>Client Interaction and Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Communication:</b> The client has been my Graduate Supervisor before getting assigned to him. I didn't need to introduce myself before talking about the case, as there had been some interaction between the client and me. I reached him via Slack
            to talk about the case. I asked a lot of questions just to confirm and make sure I got all my requirements. I requested for some documentations about the case, and he provided me with materials that helped. We had video calls via Google Meet,
            to update him on what I had done so far, at least once a week. If I had more questions, I asked during these meetings and I got swift and positive feedbacks. The stated problem is to visualize Google Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data,
            and this is related to the client's objectives which are to examine how transportation systems influence physical activity, create national level measures of transit and relate those measures to physical activity, and determine the health
            impacts of transportation interventions in Canada.
        </li>
        <li><b>Client Materials:</b>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Dataset:</b> The
                    <a href="https://transitfeeds.com/p/metrobus-transit/293"> dataset</a> is a zipped file (contains 7 comma delimited text files) of Google Transit Feed Specification (GTFS), <i>a specification that defines a data format for public transportation routes, stop, schedules,
                    and associated geographic information</i>, for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrobus_Transit">Metrobus Transit</a>, the transit agency that provides fixed-route transit services within the municipalities of St. John's, Newfoundland.
                    The data is one of the datasets a transit agency generates and shares openly with the public. GTFS feeds usually contain scheduled transit service information including stop and route locations of a particular transit agency.
                </li>
                <li><b>Code libraries:</b> The code for the visualization was written in
                    <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R language</a>, and the libraries used were:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">Tidyverse</a>, a collection of R packages for Data science, and the tidyverse packages used in these submission were:
                            <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/">dplyr</a>,
                            <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/"> ggplot2</a>, and
                            <a href="https://readr.tidyverse.org/">readr</a> for data wrangling and exploratory analysis;</li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/">Leaflet</a>, a javascript library for making interactive maps, was used for visualization.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Client Instructions: </b>The task as presented by the client was to create a map of the GTFS data for St. John’s Metrobus Transit Agency, showing changes over time due to COVID. He later stated that the maps should show the routes, stops,
                and their trip frequencies, and the resulting product could either be a standalone html file or an animated map.</li>
            <li><b>Client Product: </b>The results were submitted to the client, as a <a href="submission.html">standalone html file,</a> and the
                <a href="submission-1.r">R codes</a> used in creating the visualizations were also submitted.
            </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Methods and Design</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Domain: </b> Google Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) Data was used to show the changes in St. John's Metrobus Transit due to COVID from 20th of March, 2020 to 13th of September, 2020</li>
        <li><b>Wrangling: </b>Unzipping, Joining the dataframes, filtering, transforming</li>

    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To create a map of the bus route for ST John's showing changes overtine due ot COVID</li>
        <li>Show the stops based on trip frequency </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Why Analysis</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Derive level: action/target is "create a map".In trying to understand the effect of COVID, there is a need to study frequency of trips over time.</li>
        <li>Identify level: action/target is "show the stops". Since we are working with transit map, it will be helpful to have most-frequent and less-frequent stops visible</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Designs</h3>
    <h4>Design 1</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Illustration: </b>Zoom</li>
        <li><b>Descripton: </b>Product map can be zoomed in and out</li>
        <li><b>Purpose: </b>To view the stops more clearly</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Design 2</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Illustration: </b>Route</li>
        <li><b>Descripton: </b>Purple lines showing bus routes in ST. John's. Routes are labelled and pop-up enabled</li>
        <li><b>Purpose: </b>To display bus routes</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Design 3</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Illustration: </b>Stops Weighting by Frequency</li>
        <li><b>Descripton: </b>Size of circle markers varies according to trip frequency, stops are labelled and also pop-up enabled</li>
        <li><b>Purpose: </b>To detech most frequent and less frequent stops</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How Analysis</h3>

    <h2>Implementation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Access: </b><a href="submission.html">submission.html,</a>and <a href="submission-1.r" class="href">submission-1.r</a></li>
        <li><b>Source that influenced code: </b> <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/2014/10/plotting-gtfs-data-with-r-2/">Plotting GTFS Data with R</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Outcome: </b> Produt map shows routes, stops and can be zoomed. However, routes beyond the 3000th row couldn't be previewed. Possible guess, this action requires an even more higher computing RAM PC (I use a 12GB RAM Core i7 PC)</li>
        <li><b>Suggestions: </b>Data sets should be gathered monthly, so monthly differences can be tracked.</li>
        <li><b>Reflection: </b>The Muntzer approach helped in understanding the data sets and how to approch visualisation.</li>
    </ul>
