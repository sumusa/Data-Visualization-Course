    <h2>Problem Description and Objectives</h2>
    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Broad goal:</b> Provide visualizations to show how successful the U.S.A. has been in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to some other countries.</li>
        <li><b>Sub-goal:</b></li>
        <ol>
            <li>Compare how the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths relates to the Government Response Stringency Index over time.</li>
            <li>Show if increasingly strict measures affect the rate of infection in each of the six countries.</li>
        </ol>
    </ul>

    <h3>Materials</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Dataset:</b> The complete
            <a href="https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv"><i>COVID-19 dataset</i></a> used in this project is a collection of daily,
            <a href="https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data"> country-based covid-19 data</a> maintained by <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus"><i>Our World in Data</i></a>. It includes up-to-date data on confirmed
            cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and testing, as well as other variables of potential interest like stringency index, human development index, population, etc. It contains 50 columns and 58470 rows.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Code libraries:</b> Some of the code libraries used were
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/index.html">Pandas</a>, a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language, was used for cleaning,
                    reducing and filtering the covid-19 data.
                </li>
                <li><a href="https://plotly.com/javascript/">Plotly.js</a>, a high-level, declarative charting library used for creating various statistical graphs, charts, including 3D charts and SVG maps, was used to create two of the data visualization
                    charts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>, a javascript library that helps bring data to life by combining powerful visualization components, was also used in creating one out of the three data visualizations.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Methods and Design</h2>
    <h3><b>Data</b></h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Data Wrangling:</b> The dataset was preprocessed using Pandas in
            <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebook</a>, an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. The
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_pre-processing#:~:text=Data%20preprocessing%20includes%20cleaning%2C%20Instance,data%20processing%20can%20be%20interpreted.">data prepocessing</a> involved the following:
            <ul>
                <li> detecting, removal and filling of missing values in the records, although all missing values couldn't be removed as they may indicate that there were no covid cases/deaths/tests for that day. Some of the missing values were replaced with
                    zero for better analysis;</li>
                <li>dropping of features or variables (columns) that didn't contain any records and were not needed for visualization;</li>
                <li>grouping and sorting the countries by their
                    <a href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi">human development index (HDI)</a>, and selecting 9 other countries around the United States' HDI, for easier comparison based on their similar capacity to respond
                    to the pandemic;</li>
                <li>adding a new column called
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection_rate">infection rate</a>, to determine the frequency of occurrence of new covid cases for particular days. The percentage was calculated by dividing the number of cases by population,
                    and multipplying by 100, for a particular day.
                </li>
                <li>exporting the
                    <a href="covid-data.csv">cleaned and preprocessed data</a>, which now contains 37 columns and 3132 rows, into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">csv</a> format for use in Plotly.js and D3.js.</li>
            </ul>
            The preprocessing jupyter notebook was converted to HTML file for easy access and it can be viewed
            <a href="covid-data-wrangling.html">here</a>
        </li>

        <li><b>What Analysis:</b></li> The dataset is principally a <b>table</b> of countries and their respective up to date covid-19 statistics.
