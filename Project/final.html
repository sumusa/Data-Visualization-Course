    <h2>Problem Description and Objectives</h2>
    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p>The problem is to examine and compare the efectiveness of the response of the USA Government to covid-19 pandemic, with 9 other countries. The success of each country should be determined based on how they have been able to detect people with the
        virus, contain and reduce the spread, treat infected individuals, and also reduce the number of deaths from the disease in their countries.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Broad goal:</b> Provide visualizations to show how successful the U.S.A. has been in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to some other countries.</li>
        <li><b>Sub-goals:</b></li>
        <ol>
            <li>Compare the number of tests performed per thousand people and per confirmed case by each country;</li>
            <li>show the case fatality rate which is the ratio of total number of confirmed deaths and confirmed cases by country;</li>
            <li>Show if increasingly strict measures, using the stringency index, affect the reproduction rate of covid-19 infection in each of the ten countries.</li>
        </ol>
    </ul>

    <h3>Materials</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Dataset:</b> The complete
            <a href="https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv "><i>COVID-19 dataset</i></a> used in this project is a collection of daily,
            <a href="https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data "> country-based covid-19 data</a> maintained by <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus "><i>Our World in Data</i></a>. It includes up-to-date data on confirmed
            cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and testing, as well as other variables of potential interest like stringency index, human development index, population, etc. It contains 50 columns and 58470 rows.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Code libraries:</b> Some of the code libraries used were
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/index.html ">Pandas</a>, a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language, was used for
                    cleaning, reducing and filtering the covid-19 data.
                </li>
                <li><a href="https://plotly.com/javascript/ ">Plotly.js</a>, a high-level, declarative charting library used for creating various statistical graphs, charts, including 3D charts and SVG maps, was used to create two of the data visualization
                    charts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://d3js.org/ ">D3.js</a>, a javascript library that helps bring data to life by combining powerful visualization components, was also used in creating one out of the three data visualizations.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Methods and Design</h2>
    <h3><b>Data</b></h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Data Wrangling:</b> The dataset was preprocessed using Pandas in
            <a href="https://jupyter.org/ ">Jupyter Notebook</a>, an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. The
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_pre-processing#:~:text=Data%20preprocessing%20includes%20cleaning%2C%20Instance,data%20processing%20can%20be%20interpreted. ">data prepocessing</a> involved the following:
            <ul>
                <li> detecting, removal and filling of missing values in the records, although all missing values couldn't be removed as they may indicate that there were no covid cases/deaths/tests for that day. Some of the missing values were replaced with
                    zero for better analysis;</li>
                <li>dropping of features or variables (columns) that didn't contain any records and were not needed for visualization;</li>
                <li>grouping and sorting the countries by their
                    <a href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi ">human development index (HDI)</a>, and selecting 9 other countries around the United States' HDI, for easier comparison based on their similar capacity to respond
                    to the pandemic;</li>
                <li>adding a new column called
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection_rate ">infection rate</a>, to determine the frequency of occurrence of new covid cases for particular days. The percentage was calculated by dividing the number of cases by population,
                    and multipplying by 100, for a particular day.
                </li>
                <li>exporting the
                    <a href="covid-data.csv ">cleaned and preprocessed data</a>, which now contains 37 columns and 3132 rows, into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values ">csv</a> format for use in Plotly.js and D3.js.</li>
            </ul>
            The preprocessing jupyter notebook was converted to HTML file for easy access and it can be viewed
            <a href="covid-data-wrangling.html ">here</a>
        </li>

        <li><b>What Analysis:</b></li> The dataset is principally a <b>table</b> and <b>field</b> dataset representing the number of confirmed covid cases, deaths, new cases, tests, reproductive rate, of ten countries, including United States. each variable
        were measured daily, and can be interpolated to calculate more variables that are relevant to the stated objectives. The dataset availability is <b>dynamic</b>, in that new items are added daily.

    <h3><b>Why Analysis</b></h3>
    <p>The stated goal is to compare the success of USA's response to covid-19 pandemic with the response of that of 9 other countries. Here are the action/target pairs identified:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Analyze level: action/target is <b>discover features</b>. The columns (confirmed cases, deaths, reproduction rate, etc), will all be presented in various charts, for the audience to disover the patterns of these variables.</li>
        <li>Search level: action/target is <b>browse trends</b>. The location is somewhat known, since we have values of the features, but the target is unknown. We are directed to find patterns, increases, decreases, majorly trends in the data observed.</li>
        <li>Query level: action/target is <b>summarize features</b>. The designs will summarize all the results accross all countries in order to determine the country with the best response to covid-19.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The first subgoal is to compare the number of tests performed per thousand people and per confirmed case by each country.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Analyze level: action/target is <b>present features</b>. The number of tests performed per thousand people and tests performed per confirmed case by a country will be presented.</li>
        <li>Search level: action/target is <b>lookup trends</b>. Find the patterns of testing across the ten countries.</li>
        <li>Query level: action/target is <b>identify distribution</b>. Identify the country with the highest or lowest tests per case and per thousand people.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The second subgoal is to show the case fatality rate which is the ratio of total number of confirmed deaths and confirmed cases by country.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Analyze level: action/target is <b>present features</b>. Present the case fatality rate of covid-19 by country.</li>
        <li>Search level: action/target is <b>lookup trends</b>. Find the patterns of covid-19 infection by the number of cases and deaths from the virus across the ten countries.</li>
        <li>Query level: action/target is <b>identify distributions</b>. Identify the country with the highest or lowest confirmed cases of covid-19 and confirmed deaths from the virus.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The third subgoal is to show if increasingly strict measures, using the stringency index, affect the reproduction rate of covid-19 infection in each of the ten countries.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Analyze level: action/target is <b>present features</b>. Present a viz showing the stringency index and reproduction rate of covid-19 across all the countries.</li>
        <li>Search level: action/target is <b>lookup correlations</b>. Find how the stringency index correlates with the reproduction rate</li>
        <li>Query level: action/target is <b>compare similarities</b>. Compare how similar or how different the patterns of the correlations of the two variables across the countries</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Design</h2>
    <h3><b>Visualizations</b></h3>
    <p>The three visualization designs I want evaluated as part of my submission include:</p>
    <h4>Viz 1</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Illustration:</b> Case Fatality Ratio (CFR) of confirmed deaths to cases from covid-19.</li>
        <div id="myDiv3 " style="width:90%; height:100% "></div>
        <script type='text/javascript' src='cfr.js'></script>
        <li><b>Description:</b> The graph below which tackles the second subgoal, shows each country's CFR (in percentage), which is the ratio of confirmed deaths to confirmed cases, or the proportion of people diagnosed who die from the disease. The lines
            are color coded by country, with the legend on the right side of the graph. To compare a particular country's CFR with that of USA, the undesired countries can be unselected by clicking on them in the legend.
        </li>
        <li><b>Sources:</b> The idea of calculating and showing the case fatality rate came from this
            <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus ">research report</a> by Our World In Data.
        </li>
        <li><b>Purpose:</b> It is assumed that countries with lower CFRs have more effective responses and treatment of diagnosed individuals with COVID-19. The line chart can be used to compare the countries' response to the treatment of infected persons.
            In countries where health systems were unable to meet the increased demand for care, CFRs might increase. Although, it can't be determined whether the causes of increased CFR could be because deaths are high or because cases are low, and the
            causes of decreased CFR is because deaths are low or cases are high.
        </li>
        <li><b>How Analysis:</b> The trend of constantly increasing case fatality rate, followed by a plateau in May 2020, following the discovery of different ways of managing the virus, until July 2020, after which there is a significant reduction in the
            CFR across all countries, this is emphasized by the connecting lines.
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Idiom:</b> Encode: Express CFR with aligned vertical position (date), and separate/order into horizontal regions by location/country.</li>
